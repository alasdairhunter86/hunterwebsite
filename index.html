<h2>CURRENT INTERESTS<h2>

<h4>Shakespeared</h4>

<p>My Shakespeare practice is rooted in the discoveries made at the reconstructed Globe on London’s Bankside.

I trained at Shakespeare’s Globe while Dominic Dromgoole was Artistic Director, where the influence of Mark Rylance was still keenly felt in the training I received from Master of Movement Glynn MacDonald, Master of Voice Stewart Pearce, and Master of Play Mike Alfreds.

I returned to the Globe as a professional to work in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse with Ben Crystal’s Passion in Practice company, under Emma Rice’s Artistic Directorship.

The first three Artistic Directors of Shakespeare’s Globe influence my own work every day.</p>

<h4>Outdoor / Site-specific / Immersive</h4>

<p>I have made work that has taken place in parks, abandoned swimming pools, museums, car parks, castles and historic buildings. I am always open to conversations about work that might take place in non-conventional spaces, and with an immersive quality.</p>

<h4>Development / Readings</h4>

<p>Development can be very useful for a playwright at a certain stage in their work to investigate specific elements of their play. I am experienced in working with playwrights at all levels of experience, to make sure they get the best out of a development process.

Rehearsed readings, when executed carefully and strategically, can be an excellent way for a writer to hear their work, and for an audience to hear and respond to a piece at a pre-production stage. I have directed rehearsed readings for playwrights at various stages in the development of their work, at theatres including the Tron and Citizens in Glasgow, the Lemon Tree in Aberdeen, and for Playwrights Studio Scotland in the Borders.</p>

<h4>Guest Directing /  Workshops</h4>

<p>Between 2012 and 2017 I was a guest director at the University of Cumbria and directed projects on various scales with undergraduate students in their second and third years. This included productions of:

I have also led workshops of varying lengths at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, Royal & Derngate, Perth Theatre, Macrobert Arts Centre and the Tron Theatre.

I am a Connections Director for NT Connections and have supported companies connected to the Lyric Belfast (2018), Traverse Theatre (2018), and Royal & Derngate (2017).</p>

<h4> Text Consultancy – Shakespeare</h4>

<p>I have an extensive knowledge of Renaissance text, language, and original pronunciation, developed over the past ten years. I can provide support to individual actors or to a full company, helping performers unlock the clues specific to Shakespeare’s verse and prose, by working directly from the First Folio of 1623 and the Quarto publications as required.</p>
